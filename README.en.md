# Alien Signals - Lua Reactive Programming System

**Version: 3.0.3** - Compatible with alien-signals v3.0.3

[简体中文 README](README.md)

## Introduction

This project is ported from [stackblitz/alien-signals](https://github.com/stackblitz/alien-signals), and is a Lua implementation of the original TypeScript reactive system.

Alien Signals is an efficient reactive programming system. It provides automatic dependency tracking and reactive data flow management capabilities for applications through a clean and powerful API.

## Core Concepts

1. Signal
   - Used to store and track reactive values
   - Automatically notifies dependent computed properties and effects when values change
   - Read and write values directly via function calls

2. Computed
   - Derived values based on other reactive values
   - Recalculated only when dependent values change
   - Automatically caches results to avoid unnecessary recalculations

3. Effect
   - Functions automatically executed when reactive values change
   - Used to handle side effects, such as updating UI, sending network requests, etc.
   - Supports cleanup and unsubscription

4. EffectScope
   - Used to batch manage and clean up multiple reactive effect functions
   - Simplifies memory management in complex systems
   - Supports nested scope structures

## Usage Example

```lua
local reactive = require("reactive")
local signal = reactive.signal
local computed = reactive.computed
local effect = reactive.effect
local effectScope = reactive.effectScope

-- Create reactive values
local count = signal(0)
local doubled = computed(function()
    return count() * 2
end)

-- Create an effect
local stopEffect = effect(function()
    print("Count:", count())
    print("Doubled:", doubled())
end)
-- Output: Count: 0, Doubled: 0

-- Modify values, which will automatically trigger related computations and effects
count(1)  -- Output: Count: 1, Doubled: 2
count(2)  -- Output: Count: 2, Doubled: 4

-- Stop effect listening
stopEffect()
count(3)  -- Won't trigger any output

-- Using effect scope
local cleanup = effectScope(function()
    -- All effect functions created within this scope
    effect(function()
        print("Scoped effect:", count())
    end)
    
    effect(function()
        print("Another effect:", doubled())
    end)
end)

count(4)  -- Triggers all effect functions in the scope
cleanup()  -- Cleans up all effect functions in the scope
count(5)  -- Won't trigger any output
```

## Advanced Features

### Batch Updates

When performing multiple state updates, you can use batch update mode to avoid triggering effects multiple times, improving performance.

```lua
local reactive = require("reactive")
local signal = reactive.signal
local effect = reactive.effect
local startBatch = reactive.startBatch
local endBatch = reactive.endBatch

local count = signal(0)
local multiplier = signal(1)

effect(function()
    print("Result:", count() * multiplier())
end)
-- Output: Result: 0

-- Without batch updates: the effect executes twice
count(5) -- Output: Result: 5
multiplier(2) -- Output: Result: 10

-- With batch updates: the effect executes only once
startBatch()
count(10)
multiplier(3)
endBatch() -- Output: Result: 30
```

The system uses the following techniques to implement reactivity:

1. Dependency Tracking
   - Uses function closures and binding mechanism for the object system
   - Tracks the currently executing computation or effect through global state
   - Automatically collects and manages dependencies, building a reactive data dependency graph

2. Doubly Linked List Dependency Management
   - Uses efficient doubly linked list structure to manage dependencies
   - O(1) time complexity for dependency addition and removal operations
   - Automatically cleans up dependencies that are no longer needed, preventing memory leaks

3. Dirty Value Checking and Optimization
   - Employs efficient bit operations for dirty value checking
   - Intelligently determines when to recalculate derived values
   - Precise dependency graph traversal algorithm

4. Update Scheduling System
   - Uses a queue to manage pending effect functions
   - Intelligently merges multiple updates to reduce unnecessary computations
   - Supports batch updates to improve performance

## Linked List Structure In Detail

The core of Alien Signals is a dependency tracking system implemented using doubly-linked list structures. Each link node exists simultaneously in two different linked lists, enabling efficient dependency collection and notification propagation.

### Link Node Structure

Each link node contains the following fields:

```lua
{
    dep = dep,        -- Dependency object (Signal or Computed)
    sub = sub,        -- Subscriber object (Effect or Computed)
    prevSub = prevSub, -- Previous node in the subscriber chain
    nextSub = nextSub, -- Next node in the subscriber chain
    prevDep = prevDep, -- Previous node in the dependency chain
    nextDep = nextDep  -- Next node in the dependency chain
}
```

### Doubly Linked List Diagram

**Core Principle**: Each Link node exists in two lists simultaneously:
- **Subscriber Chain (Vertical)**: Links all subscribers downward from dependency source (Signal/Computed)
- **Dependency Chain (Horizontal)**: Links all dependency sources rightward from subscriber (Effect/Computed)

This design achieves O(1) dependency add/remove and efficient notification propagation.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Doubly Linked List Structure"
        Signal["Signal<br/>(Data Source)"]
        Computed["Computed<br/>(Derived)"]
        Effect["Effect<br/>(Side Effect)"]
        
        Signal -->|subs| Link1["Link Node 1"]
        Link1 -->|nextSub| Link2["Link Node 2"]
        
        Computed -->|subs| Link3["Link Node 3"]
        
        Effect -->|deps| Link4["Link Node 4"]
        Link4 -->|nextDep| Link5["Link Node 5"]
        
        Link1 -.->|sub points to| Effect
        Link2 -.->|sub points to| Effect
        Link3 -.->|sub points to| Effect
        
        Link4 -.->|dep points to| Signal
        Link5 -.->|dep points to| Computed
    end
    
    style Signal fill:#e1f5ff
    style Computed fill:#fff3e0
    style Effect fill:#f3e5f5
    style Link1 fill:#c8e6c9
    style Link2 fill:#c8e6c9
    style Link3 fill:#c8e6c9
    style Link4 fill:#ffccbc
    style Link5 fill:#ffccbc
```

**How it works**:
1. **Dependency Collection**: Effect executes → accesses Signal → creates Link node → adds to both Signal's subs list and Effect's deps list
2. **Notification Propagation**: Signal changes → traverses subs list → notifies all subscribers to execute
3. **Dependency Cleanup**: Before Effect re-executes → traverses deps list → removes itself from old dependencies

### Link Process

**Principle**: When Effect executes and accesses Signal, the system automatically establishes dependency relationship.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant E as Effect
    participant S as Signal
    participant L as Link Node
    
    Note over E,S: Initial state: No connection
    E->>S: Access Signal value
    S->>S: Detect activeSub=Effect
    S->>L: Create new Link node
    L->>S: Add to Signal.subs list
    L->>E: Add to Effect.deps list
    Note over E,S: Dependency established
    
    rect rgb(200, 230, 201)
        Note right of L: Link structure:<br/>dep=Signal<br/>sub=Effect<br/>bidirectional pointers
    end
```

**Key Steps**:
1. **Detect Access**: When Signal is read, check global activeSub
2. **Create Link**: If activeSub exists, create Link node connecting them
3. **Prevent Duplicates**: Check if dependency already exists to avoid duplication
4. **Bidirectional Connection**: Link added to both Signal.subs and Effect.deps

### Unlink Process

**Principle**: When Effect re-executes or is destroyed, old dependency relationships need to be cleaned up.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant E as Effect
    participant L as Link Node
    participant S as Signal
    
    Note over E,S: Established dependency
    E->>E: Re-execute/Destroy
    E->>L: Traverse deps list
    L->>S: Remove from Signal.subs
    L->>E: Remove from Effect.deps
    L->>L: Destroy Link node
    Note over E,S: Dependency cleaned up
```

**Key Steps**:
1. **Trigger Timing**: Before Effect re-executes or when destroyed
2. **Traverse Dependencies**: Find all Link nodes through deps list
3. **Bidirectional Removal**: Remove from both Signal.subs and Effect.deps
4. **Memory Release**: Link node is garbage collected

### Complex Scenario Example

**Principle**: The reactive system supports multi-level dependency relationships, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Signal A] -->|notify| E1[Effect 1]
    A -->|notify| C[Computed C]
    E1 -->|read| B[Signal B]
    B -->|notify| E2[Effect 2]
    B -->|notify| C
    C -->|notify| E3[Effect 3]
    C -->|read| D[Signal D]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style B fill:#e1f5ff
    style D fill:#e1f5ff
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style E1 fill:#f3e5f5
    style E2 fill:#f3e5f5
    style E3 fill:#f3e5f5
```

**Data Flow**:
1. **Signal A** changes → triggers **Effect 1** and **Computed C**
2. **Effect 1** executes → may modify **Signal B**
3. **Signal B** changes → triggers **Effect 2** and **Computed C** (again)
4. **Computed C** updates → triggers **Effect 3**

**Optimization Mechanisms**:
- **Dirty Checking**: Computed only recalculates when dependencies change
- **Batch Updates**: Multiple Signals change simultaneously, Effect executes only once
- **Topological Sort**: Ensures dependencies update in correct order, avoiding redundant calculations

This complex dependency relationship is efficiently managed through the doubly-linked list structure, achieving O(1) time complexity for dependency operations.

## Considerations

1. Performance Optimization
   - Avoid accessing too many reactive values in a single computed property
   - Use batch updates judiciously to improve performance
   - Don't modify other reactive values inside computed properties

2. Circular Dependencies
   - Although the system can intelligently handle some circular dependencies
   - It's still recommended to avoid complex circular dependencies
   - Uses bit flags to prevent infinite recursion and stack overflow

3. Memory Management
   - System automatically manages dependency relationships
   - Effects no longer in use are automatically cleaned up
   - Use effectScope to manage multiple effects in complex components

4. Lua 5.1 Compatibility
   - Supports Lua 5.1
   - All examples and tests are compatible with both Lua 5.1 and newer versions
